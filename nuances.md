   The below image is a snippet of a title page which usually talks about the entity name, some details about the type of the document and other similar facts scattered across the page.  Similar to this there are Directory pages which present information in an irregular, visually-organized, two-dimensional format. Directory pages are fairly common in financial prospectuses and carry information about organizations, their addresses and relationships between those  ; and understanding their structure is a key to various business tasks.  Another example of this sort can be signature pages which are often accompanied by a lot of hand written text and identifying things like the signature blocks becomes crucial to figure out if a given agreement is executed or not.

   The text in these documents  is formally organized into sections and sub sections. There are enumerated and bulleted lists which are often wrapped up to look like a paragraph. These are quite common in Credit agreements which are full of clauses and in order to correctly extract the underlying mathetical equation, we need to understand this sentence hierarchy in depth.

   This snippet is full of hyperlinks. Since these documents are quite long, there is often a definition section present in the beginning of the document and then there are references to those all over the documents. If we have sections and sub sections , weâ€™ll also have references to them. In order to understand the text in detail we need to follow those references and get the details out.

4)  Another interesting paradigm that you will find in financial documents is the notion of temporality. There are inline edits and strikethroughs present in the text. If that was not enough, often these documents are accompanied by amendments which play an important role in understanding the bigger picture.  The problem even becomes more complicated when these amendments are often attached at the bottom of the main document and then we need to first establish the notion of a main doc span and then attend to all the exhibits and amendments that come in the later part of the document.
