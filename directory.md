  * Curated a dataset depicting the reading order for the Directory page documents
  * Proposed a novel set of features and trained a random forest model for identifying Directory pages( usually a couple of pages in a 300 page long document) in Prospectuses
  * Proposed and implemented parsing of text present in directory pages in a tree-structured format. This
    enabled downstream Relation extraction tasks to be performed with ease
