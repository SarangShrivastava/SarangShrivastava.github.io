I am currently working as an applied natural language processing scientist in the CoreAI group of Goldman Sachs. I am fortunate to work closely with < a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yT1DBNsAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"> Dr. Vijay Saraswat </a>, Dr. Johannes Hoffart and Dr. Luciano Del Corro.

I am currently a second-year PhD student in the VICO group with <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hbilen/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Hakan Bilen</a> at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh. I am also fortunate to work closely with  <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/keller/" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Keller</a> and  <a href="https://basurafernando.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Basura Fernando</a>. 
      
<br />Previously, I spend some wonderful years in Singapore working as a Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg" target="_blank">A*STAR AI Initiative</a>.

<br />In my research, I am interested in solving problems related to long-tail recognition and few-shot/zero-shot learning for vision and language domain specific applications. 

My broad research intrests also span very interesting and emerging research areas such as multi-modal emotion recognition, social relationship understanding, image captioning and multi-modal adversarial attacks.  

<br />
I majored in electronics and communication engineering as a bachelor student, eventually finding passion for machine learning and itâ€™s applications.

Feel free to drop me an email for research discussions, collaborations or just chatting!
