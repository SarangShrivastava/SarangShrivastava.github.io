I am currently working as a natural language processing researcher in the CoreAI group of Goldman Sachs. I am fortunate to work closely with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yT1DBNsAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Vijay Saraswat</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=odKVNH0AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Johannes Hoffart</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=vJfDxrIAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Luciano Del Corro</a>.

[comment]: <> (<br />Previously, I spend some wonderful years in Singapore working as a Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg" target="_blank">A*STAR AI Initiative</a>.)

<br /> I want to leverage visual, structural and textual information in natural language and feed it into machines to help them learn better representations and reason with text just like a human does. A direction that I would love to explore further but not limited to would be in the field of Multi-modal Long Document AI.
<br />
<br />
I majored in computer science and engineering as a bachelor student, eventually finding passion for natural language processing and itâ€™s applications.
