<br />I am a machine learning enthusiast who loves solving real world problems using algorithms that are powered by data, logic and reasoning. I have 5+ years of experience in designing, developing and fielding NLP/ML solutions for problems into production which leads to value generation. Currently, I am focusing on improving the data quality for the firm in the Legal Entities and Products space using Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).

<br />I have also worked on a variety of problems in the space of DocumentAI ranging across, but not limited to, document structure understanding, representation learning, entity recognition, relation extraction, learning to rank, layout-aware language models and tabular structure understanding.
<br />
<br />I have been fortunate enough to work closely with excellent researchers and mentors in this space: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yT1DBNsAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Vijay Saraswat</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=odKVNH0AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Johannes Hoffart</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=vJfDxrIAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Luciano Del Corro</a>.

I am also fortunate to work closely with  <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/keller/" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Keller</a> and  <a href="https://basurafernando.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Basura Fernando</a>. )

[comment]: <> (<br /> I want to leverage visual, structural and textual information in natural language and feed it into machines to help them learn better representations and reason with text just like a human does. A direction that I would love to explore further but not limited to would be in the field of Multi-modal Long Document AI.)
