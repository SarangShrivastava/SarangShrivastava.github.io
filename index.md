<br /> Currently spearheading the development of a Generative AI stack for applications in movies, sports, and entertainment sector at Language Machines.
<br />

<br />
Over 8 years of industry expertise, with a specialized focus in the last 6+ years on the design, development, and deployment of advanced NLP/LLM based solutions in the financial domain. Proven track record in enhancing data quality for critical financial operations, specifically in the realms of Legal Entities and Products, employing state-of-the-art Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).
<br />

<br />
I have worked on a variety of problems in the space of DocumentAI ranging across, but not limited to, document
structure understanding, representation learning, entity recognition, relation
extraction, learning to rank, layout-aware language models and tabular structure
understanding.
<br />

<br />
I want to leverage visual, structural and textual information in natural language and feed it into machines to help them learn better representations and reason with text just like a human does.
<br />

<br />I have been fortunate enough to work closely with excellent researchers and mentors in this space: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yT1DBNsAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Vijay Saraswat</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=odKVNH0AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Johannes Hoffart</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=vJfDxrIAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Luciano Del Corro</a>.
