[comment]: <> (<br />Previously, I spend some wonderful years in Singapore working as a Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg" target="_blank">A*STAR AI Initiative</a>.)

<br /> I want to leverage visual, structural and textual information in natural language and feed it into machines to help them learn better representations and reason with text just like a human does. 
A direction that I would love to explore further but not limited to would be in the field of Multi-modal Long Document AI.

<br />

I majored in computer science and engineering as a bachelor student, eventually finding passion for natural language processing and it’s applications.
